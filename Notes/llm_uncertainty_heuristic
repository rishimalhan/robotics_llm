# LLM Planners
LLM strengths lie in common sense reasoning
Weakness is confident hallucinations
It is important for LLM based planners to know when they don't know and ask for help
KnowNo builds on theory of conformal predictions to provide statistical guarantee on task completion
Baselines may involve extensive fine tuning
KnowNo requires no finetuning

# Ambiguity Modes
Spatial and Numeric
Human preference to winograd schema

# Conformal Prediction
Conformal prediction is a method in ML and statistical inference to provide confidence to predictions
It extends the idea of confidence to individual prediction than an entire population.

Technique to provide statistical guarantees without assumptions on the prediction model.
Applies a non-conformity measure called score function to labeled sets.
The score is computed on unlabeled point.
Comparing this score with labeled dataset, prediction region is determined

# Uncertainty Alignment
Sufficient help from human to ensure satistical guarantee of a task while also minimizing help
Calibrated confidence + Minimal Help

# Approach KnowNo
A calibrated set similar to type of instruction LLM will be receiving is used as prefix to messages
Command is sent and LLM is asked to generate options like MCQs
Likelihood of why LLM predicted each option is computed (I think based on CP from given dataset)
For a task success rate defined by humans, if prediction set is singleton then robot moves otherwise
For higher set size, it calls human for help

# Addon
- Provide examples of diaglogues and interactions serving as basis for upcoming question
- Given options generated, determine the likelihood of generating a specific response given probabilities
